This is the Bootstrap Theme developer, made specifically for Spectrum.

NPM = Node Package Manager

Required Software:
Node (use Node Package manager to install Grunt + Bower) - probably use the Node app as a standalone (i.e. non *.exe) app
	Grunt : http://bower.io/#install-bower
	Bower : http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

HINT: UBUNTU comes with nodejs. if `which node` comes back empty, run teh following
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

After installing above prerequisites, run the following (in order)

NPM install
bower install
grunt

NOTES:
1) If you want On The Fly Updates, run `grunt dev`
2) There is also a `grunt tidy` that removes the build folder - This no longer works as it outside
